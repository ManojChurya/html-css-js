    <h1><u>Recycling Guide: Plastic, Glass, Metal, Paper, And More</u></h1>
<br><h2>With recycling guidelines varying by geography and municipality, we understand that putting the right item in the right bin isn’t always the easiest. With a variety of labels, changing regulations and codes, and new products on the market, it’s hard to keep up. That’s why we’ve created this guide to broadly inform your recycling decisions with best practices across plastic, glass, metal, paper, and more. Check it out:</h2>

<h3>Plastic, Glass, Metal, Paper
</h3>

<div class="left"><h1><u>Plastic</u></h1></div>
<p>With a little bit of information, much plastic can be recycled. Plastic recycling faces one huge problem: plastic types must not be mixed for recycling, yet it is impossible to tell one type from another by sight or touch. Even a small amount of the wrong type of plastic can ruin the process. The plastic industry has responded to this problem by developing a series of markers, commonly seen on the bottom of plastic containers:
<br>
<br>
These markers do not mean the plastic can be recycled OR that the container uses recycled plastic. Despite the confusing use of chasing arrow symbol, these markers only identify the plastictype.

<p>Standard Glass: Bottles, Jars, And More
Glass is completely recyclable and saves precious energy resources. Making products from recycled glass uses less energy than starting from scratch. Recycled glass is made into new beverage bottles, food jars, insulation and other construction materials.glass-bottles-jars.jpg
The downside with glass is that often times it is heavy and difficult to transport—often times, bottles have to travel further to manufacturing plants for reuse.

<div class="left"><h1><u>Metal</u></h1></div>
 <p>The good thing about metal recycling is that metal can be recycled over and over without altering its properties. The most common recyclable metals include aluminum and steel. The other metals, for example, silver, copper, brass and gold, are so valuable that they are rarely thrown away to be collected for recycling.</p>

<p>Things You Should Know When Recycling Paper:

You don’t have to remove staples, plastic windows, spirals from notebooks. These get strained out when the paper is turned to pulp.
Any dirty or greasy paper, including napkins, cannot be recycled!</p><br><br><hr>
